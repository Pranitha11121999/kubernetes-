1. Update all at once but prefer to update one after the other this is called the rolling update 
2. if there was a issue we would like to rollback the changes 
3. scaling, resource management - in this case we dont want to apply changes immediately but whould like to pause to your environmnet
4. Each application is encapsulated in a pod and the multiple sites are deployed using replication controllers 
5. After all this is done comes the kubernetes deployment which has a higher hierarchy.
6. The deployment provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlining istances in rolling updates 

Deployment:
Deployment definition file is same as the replication definition file except for the kind: Deploment 
Definition file:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deploymnet
metadata: 
  name: myapp-deploymnet
  labels:
      app: myapp
      type: front-end

              type: front-end
          spec:
