To create a file use vim ex: vim pod.yaml
- Inside the Yaml file we need to mention 
    1. apiVersion
    2. kind
    3. metadata
    4. spec
- The details inside the each key is (**the keys are case sensistive**)(**make sure the indentation are right typically 2 spaces not recommended to use tab**)
    1. apiVersion - v1
    2. kind - Pod
    3. metadata - 
                  name: nginx
                  labels:
                      app:nginx 
                      tier: (** this is used for grouping**) frontend
    4. spec
          containers:(**it is a list of objects **)
                - name: nginx
                  image: nginx(**if we are using other repository instead of docker hub then add the full path here**)
** we can also add additional conatiners for that we need to add secondary element in the conatiners. the secondary elemet is created by 
              - name:
                image:
              - name:(**secondary**)
                image:

- then in the cli we can use kubectl apply -f pod.yaml or kubectl create it doesnt matter
